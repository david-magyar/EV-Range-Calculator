# EV-Range-Calculator

About the website

Electric cars became incredibly popular, but this new way of travelling raises many questions. Maybe the most complex and also everyone's first question is: „How far can I go?”. With this EV Range Calculator, we can estimate the range of different electric cars based on speed, battery degradation, temperature and actual state of charge.

Functions to add in future:
- Make the design responsive
- Theme color changing
- Saving calculations into user profiles
- Exporting configuration and data
